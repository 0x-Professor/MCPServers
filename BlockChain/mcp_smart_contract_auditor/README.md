## üöÄ Features

- **Automated Vulnerability Detection**: Scans Solidity smart contracts for common and advanced vulnerabilities (reentrancy, overflows, access control, unchecked calls, timestamp dependencies, and more).
- **Gas Optimization Analysis**: Identifies inefficient code patterns and suggests gas-saving improvements.
- **DeFi & Oracle Risk Assessment**: Specialized checks for DeFi protocols, oracles, and MEV exposure.
- **Compliance Checks**: Validates contracts against ERC standards and regulatory best practices (GDPR, SEC, etc.).
- **Attack Simulation**: Simulates common attack vectors (reentrancy, flash loan, front-running, sandwich attacks).
- **Upgradeability & Proxy Analysis**: Detects risks in upgradeable/proxy contract patterns.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Monitors deployed contracts for changes, suspicious activity, and on-chain events.
- **Modular & Extensible**: Easily add new analysis modules, patterns, or compliance checks.
- **API-First**: Exposes all functionality via a modern FastAPI interface for integration with CI/CD, dashboards, or other tools.
