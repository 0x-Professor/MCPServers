actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No

sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or

Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.
